# reluax
`reluax` is a Rust webserver that generates its pages through LuaX, an extended
form of Lua with support for inline HTML that gets preprocessed into tables.

## Inspiration
The project was heavily, heavily inspired by Ben Visness' blog post,
[I made JSX for Lua (because I hate static sites)](https://bvisness.me/luax/),
which I highly recommend reading.
